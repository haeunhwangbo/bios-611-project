# Motivation

Elon Musk tweets’ influence on Tesla, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin prices
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is curently one of the most influential businessmen 
on the planet. He is well known to be active on social media, especially Twitter. 
His tweets have been caught up in various controversies, sometimes creating chaos for 
the stockholders of his companies. His tweets have also caused the prices of 
cryptocurrencies to swing wildly in the past two years. For instance, after his first 
tweet about Dogecoin, a lesser-known cryptocurrency at that time, the prices of this crypto 
skyrocketed. A Bloomberg opinion columnist, Matt Levine, made a remark on this phenomenon, 
calling it “the Elon Markets Hypothesis”. Levine commented “the way finance works now is that 
things are valuable not based on their cash flows but on their proximity to Elon Musk.” 
This motivated the project.

# Objective

In this project, I will build random forest classifiers that predict daily percent changes and
intraday volatility of bitcoin, dogecoin, and tesla prices from Elon Musk's tweets.
The timeframe will be between January 1st of 2021 to December 31th of 2021. 

# Explorartory Analysis

## Twitter

Elon Musk's twitter data was obtained from [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hisanai/elon-musk-tweets-5-years?select=Elon+2020-2021.csv)).
The text content of the tweet, number of likes, number of retweets, number of replies, 
and existance of media was obtained.

I first asked what the monthly trends of these tweet statistics looked like (Figure 1).

![Monthly tweet statistics](figures/monthly_tweet_stats.png)

The next thing I asked was what are the most frequently used words in his tweet. For text
preprocessing, all letters were converted to lower case and hashtags, stop words, and digits were
removed. 

![Frequently used word counts](figures/tweet_word_counts.png)

The top 2 words used in his tweets were `tesla` and `spacex`, which are both companies he owns 
(Figure 2).

From the word cloud, we also see `bitcoin` and `doge` are also mentioned frequently (Figure 3).


## Stock/crypto prices

For stock/crypto prices, I focused on the three variables: `Close price`, `Intraday Volatility`, 
and `Interday Change`. Intraday volatility measure how the prices fluctate within a day. I used
Garman & Klass (1980) definition:
$$GK = 0.5 \log{(High/Low)}^2 - (2log2-1)\log{(Close/Open)}^2$$
Interday cahnge was measured as percentage change between close prices between two consecutive 
days. I first investigated the trends of these variables over time (Figures 4-6).

## Crude Analysis

My hypothesis was that the mention of the stock/crypto (i.e., bitcoin, dogecoin, tesla, etc.)
would be the most direct predictor of the that stock/crypto's price changes and volatility. 
I first investigated when these words were mentioned (Figures 7 and 8). 

![Mention timeline interday change](figures/tweet_mentions_interday_change_lineplot.png)

![Mention timeline intraday volatility](figures/tweet_mentions_intraday_volatility_lineplot.png)

For a crude analysis, I used t-test to see whether there were differences in the days when the 
stock/crypto was mentioned or not mentioned (Figures 9 and 10).

![Mention vs. interday change boxplot](figures/tweet_mentions_interday_change_boxplot.png)

![Mention vs. intraday volatility boxplot](figures/tweet_mentions_intraday_volatility_boxplot.png)

Out of the six comparisons, bitcoin's intraday volatility showed significant difference 
(p=0.027, two-sided t-test).

# Model Prediction

## Preparing Input Data

Initially, the following features were considered as input variables.
- number of tweets per day
- average likes per day
- average retweets per day
- average replies per day
- sum of sentiment scores per day
- existence of attached media
- mention of bitcoin, BTC
- mention of doge
- mention of tesla, TSLA

For sentiment scoring, I used `afinn` data from `tidytext` library, which scores a set 
of common words by there sentiment ranging from -5 to 5. I investigated if any of these 
variables are strongly correlated (Figure 11).

![Correlation between input variables](figures/model_variables_pairplot.png)

Average liks and average retweets were most strongly correlated, and thus, average retweets
were removed from model input.

## Model outcomes

I decided to use binary variables for interday change and intraday volatility.
Interday Change > 0 was considered as positive. Intraday volatility above median was
cosidered positive.

## Building the Model

I built 6 random forest classifiers for each BTC Interday Change, BTC Intraday Volatility,
DOGE Interday Change, DOGE Intraday Volatility, TSLA Interday Change, and TSLA Intraday Volatility.
I used `sci-kit learn`'s random forest classifier to build the models. The train and test
sets were divdied by 8:2 ratio. For hyperparameter tuning, randomized search with 4-fold cross
validation was used. The best models were chosen from 100 iterations. 

## Feature Importance

I first investigated which feature were important to the models (Figure 12). For all models, number of tweets,
average likes, average likes, and sentiment score were the top predictors. Surprisingly, mentions
of the stock/crypto did not have significant influence on the interday change and intraday
volatility.

## Model Performance

Model performances were tested on the test set which was never used for training. I compared each
model's precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve (Figures 13, 14).

![All models performance](figures/all_models_performance_barplot.png)

![All models ROC curves](figures/all_models_auc.png)

Out of the 6 models, the best model was for tesla interday change (F1 score: 0.71) followed by 
dogecoin intraday volatility (F1 score: 0.65). The worst model was dogecoin interday change 
(F1 score 0.33). This was a very interesting outcome. Elon musk's tweet impacted on high volatility 
within a day, but this did not carry on to daily changes. Overall, the model performance ranged from
bad (i.e. worse than random) to mediocore. However, this was not surprising, considering that there
are far more important predictors for stock/crypto prices.

## Limitations

Stock/crypto prices are timeseries data, however this aspect was not considered. Expanding the training
set (longer timeframe if the dogecoin-saga went longer) might have improved model performances. Scroing
the tweets in per-tweet level, not as daily aggregates also might have improved the models. Hypothetically,
"dogecoin is awesome!" is a stronger predictor than "dogecoin" and "I am awesome". Under the current
setting, these two results in a same input. Moreover, many of Elon Musk's tweet message was delivered
by a attached media (e.g. pictures). Only text was processed in this model.
